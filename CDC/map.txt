How to choose the optimal CDC solution for Big Data project?
  Define Data change frequency and volume
    Low
    Moderate to high
  Assess Latency requirements => Moderate to high
  Assess Latency requirements
    Real-Time or Near Real-Time (< 1 sec)
      Captures and applies data changes in real-time as they happen, ensuring immediate updates.
  Evaluate transformation complexity
    Periodic/Batch Processing (e.g., 5 min or more)
      Collects and processes data changes periodically at set intervals, updating data in batches.
  Consider infrastructure and integration
   	Cloud-Native Environments
      Prefer Delta Lake on Databricks or BigQuery"s Change Data Capture if already invested in the cloud for seamless integration
  	On-Premises or Hybrid
  	  Kafka as a messaging layer with Debezium or Flink for flexibility in both real-time and on-premises/hybrid setups
  Consider the Data storage destination
    Data Lake
      Delta Lake
      Apache Hudi
      Iceberg
      CDC in batch with incremental updates and upserts => Delta Lake, Apache Hudi, Iceberg
    Data Warehouse
      Kafka Connect can push CDC data to these warehouses in real time
      Consider native CDC capabilities like BigQueryâ€™s Dataflow templates for ingestion if using Google Cloud
FINAL_NODE: Select the CDC solution that aligns with your needs for data speed (real-time or batch), transformation complexity, and storage type (data lake or warehouse). Ensure it balances performance and cost while keeping the pipeline simple and scalable. This final choice drives efficient data updates across your system.
